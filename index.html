        <h2>Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.</h2>
        <p>
          We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
          creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
          creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
          that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network

        <h2>For Creaters</h2>
        <p>
          Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital
          currency system that is dependent on growing and engaging with the
          community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total
          value of the tokens minted.

        <h2>For Holders</h2>
        <p>
          Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to benefits
          including unreleased content, private communities, direct access to
          celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well as the ability to
          trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator
          content with early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value
          of the token increases with more buyers.

        <p class="textColor">
          There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter,
          tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we
          would be actively engaging before we go viral. We would get them on
          our platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven
          digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and
          their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their creator's
          currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency
          across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the
          Weentar popularity.

          <h2>Tokner is coming</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
          population with some countries and entities actively fighting against
          its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
          fort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
          launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite
          simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
          cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that
          even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and
          have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their
          favourite person and watch their investment as is with other crypto
          currency project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the
          "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency,
          bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to
          make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot
          of people to finally give this space a real look.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as
          countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that
          conventional social media platforms can offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would
          not find home there. Like Kanye said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be
          built on top of them".
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we
          hope he would say.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this
          time there would be no dead presidents on the money, there would
          people like you on the money, and you would own it because it would
          make the most sense in the world.
